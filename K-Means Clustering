Perform Clustering for the crime data and identify the number of clusters formed and draw inferences.

crime_data <- read.csv(file.choose())

# Normalize the data
normalized_data <- scale(crime_data[, 2:5])

# Elbow curve & k ~ sqrt(n/2) to decide the k value
twss <- NULL
for (i in 2:8) { #taking up to 8 clusters, starting from 2 clusters, 3 clusters, 4 clusters,.... 8 clusters
  twss <- c(twss, kmeans(normalized_data, centers=i)$tot.withinss)
}
twss #distance within clusters

# Look for an "elbow" in the scree plot
plot(2:8, twss, type = "b", xlab = "Number of Clusters", ylab = "Within groups sum of squares") #y-axis = twss
title(sub = "K-Means Clustering Scree-Plot")

fit <- kmeans(normalized_data, 3) # 3 clusters (we can choose based on our preference. But based on elbow curve, 3 cluster seems like a good choice)

str(fit)
fit$cluster

final <- data.frame(fit$cluster, crime_data) # form a dataframe 

aggregate(crime_data[, 2:5], by=list(fit$cluster), FUN = mean) #mean value of each cluster

A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. 
A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? 
Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. 
Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

# Normality test
shapiro.test(Unit.A)
#p-value = 0.32 > 0.05, It follows normal distribution

shapiro.test(Unit.B)
#p-value = 0.5225 > 0.05, It follows normal distribution

#Variance test
var.test(Unit.A,Unit.B)
#p-value = 0.3136 > 0.05, equal variances

#Equal Variances, then we need to proceed to 2 Sample T Test
t.test(Unit.A, Unit.B, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95) 
#p-value = 0.4723 > 0.05, Null hypothesis is accepted

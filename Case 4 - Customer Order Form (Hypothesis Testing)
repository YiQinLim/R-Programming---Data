Telecall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain %	of the customer order forms. 
Any error in order form renders it defective and must be reworked before processing.	
The manager wants to check whether the defective %	varies by center. 
Please analyze the data at 5% significance level and help the manager draw appropriate inferences
